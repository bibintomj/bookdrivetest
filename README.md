# Drive Test Booking System

This is a web-based application designed for booking drive tests in Canada. The project enables users to view available slots and book a test for their driving exam. The application uses server-side rendering with EJS templates and is built using Node.js with the Express framework.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for handling HTTP requests.
- **EJS**: Embedded JavaScript for dynamic HTML templating.
- **HTML & CSS**: Frontend structure and styling.
- **Nodemon**: Automatically restarts the server on file changes during development.
